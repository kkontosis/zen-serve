# Milestone 5 plan: zen-db, the in-app broker, CRDT tables, the zen-fs replica, Loro, and five apps

## Context

Milestone 4.5 specified the client database and broker (`spec/zendb.md`, PR #10) and later added two things (PR #11, both merged):
* index options that leak less
* server-merged CRDT tables, whose server side was moved into milestone 5

The app targets are in `docs/EXAMPLES.md`. Milestone 5 (DESIGN-3 §6) builds:
1. the `Db` class of zendb.md, parts A, B and D: database, broker and CRDT tables
2. the server side of CRDT tables
3. the zen-fs local replica, with `zen-mount` moved onto it
4. the Loro adapter
5. the five proof-of-concept apps, as small web apps

**Decisions (user):**
* **Apps:** five small web apps (kanban, chat, booking, checkout, ledger), each with a minimal browser UI. The checkout services also run as Node workers.
* **Indexes:** unique, fast, private (prolly tree, with shards and decoys) and sealed. **Not oblivious:** it becomes TD-DB-OBLIVIOUS-INDEX.
* **Packages:**
  * `packages/db` (`@zen/db`): database, broker and CRDT tables, on `@zen/client`
  * `packages/fs` (`@zen/fs`): the replica
  * `packages/loro` (`@zen/loro`)
* **Replica:** a pluggable store: memory, Node disk, IndexedDB. `zen-mount` moves onto it, which resolves TD-FUSE-REPLICA.
* **CRDT tables:** the server side is built in this milestone (DESIGN-3 §6, TD-CRDT-ROWS-SERVER).

**Out of scope:**
* the oblivious index
* M6 integrity: the authenticated tier, signed roots
* event signatures
* the server-side timer, competing consumers and consumer push (their TDs stay open)
* log retention
* release notes
* SQL

**After compaction, re-read:**
* `docs/MILESTONE-5.md` (this plan)
* `spec/zendb.md` (whole), `docs/EXAMPLES.md`
* `spec/api.md` §1–2, §5–9, §12; `spec/fs.md`; `spec/formats.md` §3–5, §11; `spec/keyspace.md` §3.3, §3.6; `spec/labels.md`
* `docs/CLIENT.md`
* `packages/client/src/{kv,log,stream,tree,fs}.ts`
* `crates/zen-server/src/{commit,tree,txn,keys,lib}.rs`; `crates/zen-proto/src/lib.rs` (Commit, CrdtOp ~1389–2090)
* `crates/zen-wasm/src/{lib,wire,crypto}.rs`; `crates/zen-core/src/{kdf,token,seal,keys}.rs`
* `crates/zen-server/tests/{common/mod.rs,fs.rs}`; `packages/client/test/helpers.ts`; `vitest.config.ts`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
* `spec/OPS.md` §4

**Branch:** `claude/brave-knuth-gk03mm`. PRs #10 and #11 are merged, so first restart it: `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B claude/brave-knuth-gk03mm origin/main`, then push with `--force-with-lease`. Open a new short PR at the end.

## Facts the work must respect (from the code survey)

**Wasm exposure.** JS can't compute any zendb.md derivation today:
* NK, `kdf`, `prf16` and `H(label, ·)` are not exported. NK is private in `zen-core/src/keys.rs:24`; `kdf` and `prf16` are in `kdf.rs:11,19`.
* `NameChain` is not exported. `kvKey` always starts at the KV root.
* Sealing is per kind; the generic `seal` (`seal.rs:104`) is crate-private.
* There is no CRDT dependency anywhere.

**CBOR.** No JS library handles arbitrary values. The test fixture `testing/cbor.ts` doesn't sort map keys and can't decode. zen-proto uses ciborium, and its determinism for arbitrary values isn't established.

**Client transactions.**
* `Transaction.get` and `range` always record a conflict or expectation. `readVersion` is private.
* `build()` lets `extra` set only `consume`, `chunks` and `crdt_ops`.
* `Tree.send` builds its own commit and owns the HLC tick, accept and rebase logic.

**Clocks.** The event HLC is a per-fs `zw.Clock` (`log.ts:62`), separate from the `TreeClock`.

**Server.**
* `crdt_ops` are validated in `commit.rs::validate` (149–184) and applied through `tree::Engine` (`apply` 670–741, `flush` 744–786) inside `txn_loop!`. The server retries only when there is no `read_version` (`txn.rs:23`).
* `CrdtOp::target()` returns `(fs, tree)`. `CommitResult.dots` comes from the fs write counter.
* `check_clock` (`tree.rs:473`) can be reused.
* The sweeper is `lib.rs:325–356`, then `tree::sweep`, in pages of 1000 with up to 100 rounds.
* `/v1/info` features are hard-coded at `lib.rs:67`. The router is `lib.rs:167–298`.
* **Key prefix clash:** `"cr"` is taken by `keys::chunk_refs` (`keys.rs:396`). zendb.md §19.5's row-register key needs another prefix (`"co"`).

**Tests and CI.**
* `fs.rs` has a xorshift property test against an in-memory reference (353–412). Tests run on both backends with `ZEN_TEST_BACKEND=fdb`.
* Vitest: each test file spawns its own server (`packages/client/test/helpers.ts:20`).
* The CI `client` job is `.github/workflows/ci.yml:89–131`.

## Step 0: persist the plan
* Restart the branch from `main` (above).
* Write `docs/MILESTONE-5.md` (this plan) and link it from DESIGN-3 §6 item 5.
* README status: milestone 5 "in progress".
* Commit and push.

## Step 1: spec fixes found while planning (⚠️ SPEC CHANGES, `spec:` commits)
1. **CRDT rows on the wire:**
   * the key prefixes of zendb.md §19.5 move into `keyspace.md` as §3.8, using `"co"` instead of `"cr"`
   * `api.md` §6 gets the `row`/`lww`/`ctr`/`add`/`rem` CrdtOp variants
   * a new `api.md` §13 holds `/v1/crdt/get` and `/v1/crdt/range` and the `"crdt_rows"` feature
   * `CommitResult` gains `set_dots: [bytes(12)]` for `add` ops. They are numbered among the commit's `add`s, separate from fs `dots`; zendb.md §19.3 is amended.
2. **Deterministic CBOR for zen-db values:** the exact rules (RFC 8949 §4.2.1), float encoding (always 64-bit), and the integer range, in zendb.md §1. The JS and Rust encoders must match the vectors.
3. **`formats.md` §4:** kind 7 is no longer "reserved" once implemented.
4. **Vectors:** `spec/test-vectors/zendb.json`, per zendb.md §17 and §19.9.

## Step 2: zen-core and zen-wasm (Rust)

**zen-core, new module `db`:**
* `DbKeys::new(fs_keys, ns)`, which derives K_db inside Rust, so NK never reaches JS. It provides:
  * `boundary(index_id)` and `node_id(index_id, node_bytes)`
  * `shard(index_id, pk, K)`
  * `crdt(table_id)` → field and element tokens
  * `parts_digest`
* `NameChain` from an arbitrary root, for KV paths under the database. The existing `kv_key` covers `("zen", "db", ns, …)`; check.
* Sort-key encoding (§5.1).
* The prolly canonical chunker: boundary test, levels, Node encoding.
* A deterministic CBOR `Value` encoder and decoder (a small, own implementation, or ciborium plus key sorting).
* `seal_crdt_value` and `open_crdt_value` (kind 7).
* Group id derivation (`zen/v1/broker-group`) on TopicKeys.
* Vectors added to `gen_vectors`.

**zen-wasm:**
* bindings for the above: `FsKeys.db(ns)` → `DbKeys` handle; `TopicKeys.groupId(name)`; `encodeValue`/`decodeValue` (JS value ↔ deterministic CBOR); `sortKey(fields, values, pk)`; `prollyBoundary`/`nodeId`; kind-7 seal and open
* new wire types in `wire.rs`

Every new export goes in a lean module. Re-measure the wasm size and update `docs/STATS.md`.

## Step 3: server side of CRDT tables (zendb.md §19, TD-CRDT-ROWS-SERVER)
* **zen-proto:**
  * the `CrdtOp` variants `Row`, `Lww`, `Ctr`, `Add`, `Rem`, with `target()` generalized to an enum (tree or object)
  * `CommitResult.set_dots`
  * `CrdtGet`, `CrdtRange` and `ObjState`, with the `ts` derives
* **zen-server:**
  * **`crdt.rs`:** an engine that applies row, lww, ctr, add and rem inside the commit transaction, reusing `check_clock` and `Ts` ordering, with the merge rules of §19.3
  * **`validate`:** permission, `max_value_bytes` and byte estimates per variant
  * **quotas:** quota deltas as KV writes
  * **keyspace:** the `co`/`cw`/`cn`/`cs`/`cv`/`cd` keys
  * **sweeper:** purges dead objects past the horizon, in batches
  * **routes:** `/v1/crdt/get` and `/v1/crdt/range`, with the `fs` read right and paging
  * **`/v1/info`:** advertises `"crdt_rows"`
* **Tests, `tests/crdt.rs`:**
  * the merge rules, skew and horizon, replays (`ctr` seq, idempotent `commit_id`), add-wins, delete vs. update
  * permissions, the sweeper purge
  * **property test:** three devices, random ops, shuffled arrival, compared against an in-memory reference, three seeds (same pattern as `fs.rs`)
  * a cross-node test on FDB
  * every test on both backends

## Step 4: `@zen/client` prerequisites
* **`Transaction`:**
  * `snapshotGet(paths)` and `snapshotRange`: reads at the transaction's read version, with no conflict or expect (for prolly nodes)
  * a public `readVersion`
  * `expectKey(path, version)`, to put cached records into the read set (G9)
* **`Tree`:** split `send` into `prepare(ops)` → `crdt_ops` + chunks, and `accept(result)`, so `tx.fs(tree)` can add ops to a transaction's commit and the rebase runs inside the transaction's retry. Add `Tree.writeIn(tx, …)` for an already-uploaded file.
* **Clocks:** one HLC per session, shared by events, trees and CRDT rows (`TreeClock`).
* `CommitResult.set_dots` passed through.

## Step 5: `@zen/db` part A, the database (zendb.md §2–9)
`packages/db/src/`:
* **Structure:** `db.ts` (the `Db` class, open and catalog), `catalog.ts`, `row.ts` (encoding, parts, padding), `sortkey` via wasm.
* **Indexes:**
  * `index/unique.ts`, `index/fast.ts`
  * `index/prolly.ts`: canonical tree, read, write, shards, decoys and padding
  * `index/sealed.ts`
* **The rest:**
  * `query.ts`: planner, paging, re-check
  * `txn.ts`: `transaction` with short, long and auto; `begin`; commit assembly; limits budget
  * `migrate.ts`: steps, paged backfill, drops
  * `tabs.ts`: Web Locks owner, `BroadcastChannel` proxy, `SharedWorker` where available
  * `importRows`

**Tests:**
* CRUD; unique conflicts between two clients
* queries against a naive model (property)
* prolly history independence (random insert and delete orders give the same root)
* shard and decoy behaviour, sealed blob cap
* long, short and auto modes
* migrations resumed after a kill
* the cache-staleness retry
* commit-limit errors

## Step 6: `@zen/db` part B, the broker (zendb.md §10–13)
* **Base:** `msg.ts` (Msg encoding, BodyRef, causation), `emit`, `on` (plain, `after`, `cursor`), `consume` (group id, the loop table of §11.3, `ack`, `begin({consumes})`), the system tables, ephemeral messages.
* **Patterns:**
  * work queues: spread mode; `retry: "delay"`
  * request/reply: inbox, `serve`, dedup, ephemeral replies, scatter-gather
  * scheduler leader: `$sched`, `gc` jobs, `cancel`
  * sagas: orchestrator, compensations, timeouts
  * `dedup`, `tx.after`, change events
* **Tests:** the guarantees and failures tables of §13, with fault injection:
  * killed handlers mid-transaction, deposed leaders, dropped streams
  * `commit_id` replays, scheduler failover, an owner tab closing (simulated owners)

## Step 7: `@zen/db` part D, CRDT tables (zendb.md §19)
* `crdt.ts`: `patch`, `incr`, `add`, `remove`, `delete`, the merged view through `/v1/crdt/*`
* change-event appends, the `$index` indexer group and `$ixrows`
* the offline queue: memory, or the persisted store of step 8, with rebase on `stale_op`
* `"crdt_rows"` feature detection

**Tests:** offline edits merging, counters across devices, add-wins sets, indexer lag and re-check, an indexer restart.

## Step 8: `@zen/fs`, the local replica (DESIGN-3 §6, TD-FUSE-REPLICA)
* **Model.** The node table and chunk store are kept current through `tree.changes`. Local ops are applied optimistically and queued while offline, then sent (with rebase).
* **POSIX-ish API:** `readFile`, `writeFile` (changed chunks only), `readdir`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `rename`, `unlink`, `rmdir`, `symlink`/`readlink`, xattrs in sealed meta, conflict copies.
* **Stores**, behind an interface:
  * `memory`
  * `node-disk`: a directory of sealed chunk files plus a node-table journal; no native deps
  * `indexeddb`: browser
  
  At rest, everything stays sealed as on the server.
* **`zen-mount`:**
  * moves onto `@zen/fs`
  * offline reads of cached files
  * `--cache-dir` becomes real
  * symlinks and xattrs
  * writes of changed chunks only
  * the existing mount tests stay green, plus offline and symlink tests
* **TDs:** resolve TD-FUSE-REPLICA.

## Step 9: `@zen/loro`, the Loro adapter (DESIGN-3 §0, §1)
* Dependency: `loro-crdt`.
* `zen.loro(db, path)`: a snapshot in a zen-db row, updates as events on a topic keyed by the document.
  * **Load:** snapshot + `read(after snapshot offset)`.
  * **Live:** `on` subscription.
  * **Local edits:** `emit` of Loro updates.
  * **Compaction:** periodic snapshots by a leader (DESIGN-2 §2.7).
* **Tests:** two clients converge; offline edits; a snapshot plus a tail load.

## Step 10: five small web apps (docs/EXAMPLES.md)
* **Layout:** `apps/{kanban,chat,booking,checkout,ledger}`, plain TypeScript and DOM with no framework, bundled with esbuild (a new dev dependency).
* **Serving:** each app is served as static files. In tests, a static server with zen-serve CORS, as in the M4 browser smoke test. They can be deployed into zen-serve's `/unencrypted`.
* **Sign-in:** password or passkey.

| App | Uses |
|---|---|
| Kanban | rows plus attachments in one commit; change events; drag; card text as a Loro doc; offline variant through CRDT fields |
| Chat | `on` with resume; ephemeral typing; presence scatter-gather; photo files; reactions as a CRDT counter |
| Booking | unique slot; waitlist `per_key` worker; reminders through the scheduler |
| Checkout | saga across stock, payment and shipping workers, as Node scripts in `apps/checkout/workers/`, with a mock payment provider that checks idempotency keys |
| Ledger | transfers with invariants; audit outbox; statement projection; paged history |

**Tests:** one Playwright end-to-end test per app, with two browser contexts where the demo needs them, following each app's "Milestone 5 demo" in EXAMPLES.md. The fault parts (killing workers, schedulers, tabs) run as vitest scenarios.

## Step 11: CI, docs, outcome
* **CI:**
  * the `rust` job covers CRDT rows on both backends (the existing fdb job)
  * the `client` job builds and tests `@zen/db`, `@zen/fs` and `@zen/loro`, the apps' bundles, and Playwright for all apps
  * check run time; split jobs if it passes ~15 minutes
* **Docs:**
  * `docs/DB.md`: usage guide of the `Db` class
  * `docs/CLIENT.md`: fs replica, zen-mount, Loro
  * `docs/STATS.md`: wasm size, prolly and sealed costs, broker latencies, CRDT row costs
  * `spec/OPS.md` pitfalls; README
* **TECH_DEBT:**
  * resolve TD-CRDT-ROWS-SERVER and TD-FUSE-REPLICA
  * add TD-DB-OBLIVIOUS-INDEX, plus anything deferred
* **Wrap-up:** the Outcome section, then a PR.

**Parallel agents.** Steps 5–6, 8 and 9 can run as agents on disjoint packages once steps 2–4 have landed. They share one `target/` (OPS.md §4.9) and never push: I verify and push.

## Verification
* **Rust:**
  * `cargo fmt --check`
  * `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, default and `--no-default-features`
  * `cargo test --all`
  * `ZEN_TEST_BACKEND=fdb cargo test -p zen-store -p zen-server --features fdb` on the local cluster
  * the wasm32 checks
  * `gen_vectors` leaves `spec/test-vectors` unchanged
* **JS:** `scripts/build-wasm.sh && npm ci && npx biome check && npx tsc --noEmit` (all packages), `npx vitest run`, `npx playwright test` (the M4 smoke test plus five apps)
* **Manually:** each app's demo script from EXAMPLES.md
* **CI:** green on rust, pure-rust, fdb and client
* **Disk:** `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`; watch disk (8 GB free at the last check).
