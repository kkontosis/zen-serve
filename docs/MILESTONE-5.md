# Milestone 5 plan: zen-db, the in-app broker, CRDT tables, the zen-fs replica, Loro, and five apps

## Context

Milestone 4.5 specified the client database and broker (`spec/zendb.md`, PR #10) and later added two things (PR #11, both merged):
* index options that leak less
* server-merged CRDT tables, whose server side was moved into milestone 5

The app targets are in `docs/EXAMPLES.md`. Milestone 5 (DESIGN-3 §6) builds:
1. the `Db` class of zendb.md, parts A, B and D: database, broker and CRDT tables
2. the server side of CRDT tables
3. the zen-fs local replica, with `zen-mount` moved onto it
4. the Loro adapter
5. the five proof-of-concept apps, as small web apps

**Decisions (user):**
* **Apps:** five small web apps (kanban, chat, booking, checkout, ledger), each with a minimal browser UI. The checkout services also run as Node workers.
* **Indexes:** unique, fast, private (prolly tree, with shards and decoys) and sealed. **Not oblivious:** it becomes TD-DB-OBLIVIOUS-INDEX.
* **Packages:**
  * `packages/db` (`@zen/db`): database, broker and CRDT tables, on `@zen/client`
  * `packages/fs` (`@zen/fs`): the replica
  * `packages/loro` (`@zen/loro`)
* **Replica:** a pluggable store: memory, Node disk, IndexedDB. `zen-mount` moves onto it, which resolves TD-FUSE-REPLICA.
* **CRDT tables:** the server side is built in this milestone (DESIGN-3 §6, TD-CRDT-ROWS-SERVER).

**Out of scope:**
* the oblivious index
* M6 integrity: the authenticated tier, signed roots
* event signatures
* the server-side timer, competing consumers and consumer push (their TDs stay open)
* log retention
* release notes
* SQL

**After compaction, re-read:**
* `docs/MILESTONE-5.md` (this plan)
* `spec/zendb.md` (whole), `docs/EXAMPLES.md`
* `spec/api.md` §1–2, §5–9, §12; `spec/fs.md`; `spec/formats.md` §3–5, §11; `spec/keyspace.md` §3.3, §3.6; `spec/labels.md`
* `docs/CLIENT.md`
* `packages/client/src/{kv,log,stream,tree,fs}.ts`
* `crates/zen-server/src/{commit,tree,txn,keys,lib}.rs`; `crates/zen-proto/src/lib.rs` (Commit, CrdtOp ~1389–2090)
* `crates/zen-wasm/src/{lib,wire,crypto}.rs`; `crates/zen-core/src/{kdf,token,seal,keys}.rs`
* `crates/zen-server/tests/{common/mod.rs,fs.rs}`; `packages/client/test/helpers.ts`; `vitest.config.ts`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
* `spec/OPS.md` §4

**Branch:** `claude/brave-knuth-gk03mm`. PRs #10 and #11 are merged, so first restart it: `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B claude/brave-knuth-gk03mm origin/main`, then push with `--force-with-lease`. Open a new short PR at the end.

## Progress and resuming

**Rhythm (user request): one step at a time, a PR per step, compact in between.** After each step:
1. Run the verification relevant to the step (below).
2. Update this section: the step's line in the log, with its PR and anything the next step must know.
3. Commit and push to `claude/brave-knuth-gk03mm`.
4. PR it:
   * If the branch's previous PR is merged, the next step starts from main: `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B claude/brave-knuth-gk03mm origin/main`, then push with `--force-with-lease`. Open a new short PR.
   * If it is still open, the step's commits join that PR; update its title and body to list the steps it holds.
5. Stop, so the user can compact. After compaction: re-read this file (the log first), then the files under "After compaction, re-read" that the next step touches.

**Log:**
* **Step 0** (plan): done, commit `2a15230`.
* **Step 1** (spec): done. keyspace.md §3.8 (`co`, not `cr`), api.md §6 CrdtOp variants and `set_dots`, api.md §13 (CRDT rows), zendb.md §1 CBOR rules, formats kind 7. Decisions beyond the plan (amended after review, see step 3): a `row`/`lww` op with a `ts` equal to the stored one is a no-op when identical and `stale_op` (rebase) when it differs; counter entries are per `(device, actor)`, the actor created once per installation, and a `seq` not newer is an already-applied re-send, ignored; GC needs a row register, so the class always inserts before writing fields.
* **Step 2** (zen-core, zen-wasm, vectors): done. See "As built" under Step 2. `spec/test-vectors/zendb.json` exists; the TS encoders of steps 5–7 must reproduce its `cbor`, `sort_keys`, `rows`, `prolly`, `sealed_index`, `crdt` and `broker` sections.
* **Step 3** (server CRDT rows): done; steps 0–3 are PR #12. Amended on review: equal-timestamp `row`/`lww` ops compare the whole record (identical → no-op, different → `stale_op`); `ctr` gained `actor` (op, `CtrEntry`, `cn` key), so a `seq` not newer is ignored. The client (step 4 on) creates the actor once per installation and keeps it with the HLC. `crates/zen-server/src/crdt.rs` (`RowEngine`, `/v1/crdt/get`, `/v1/crdt/range`, `sweep`); `tree::check_clock` is shared; the idempotency record carries `add_count`; `CrdtOp::target()` became `fs()` and `tree()`; feature `"crdt_rows"` always on. Tests `crates/zen-server/tests/crdt.rs` (9, embedded); FoundationDB runs in CI only (not installed in the session container), and the cross-node test runs only there. WASM is 2.06 MB after the new wire types (STATS updated in step 11). Steps 1–3 went into one PR, the first under this rhythm.
* **Step 4** (client prerequisites): done in PR #13, with the fdb fix of PR #12's sweeper test (it waits for commit versions, which trail the wall clock on an idle FoundationDB cluster). As designed below, with these details for the next steps:
  * `clock.ts`: `TreeClock` (alias `SessionClock`), `session.clock`, `session.useClock(clock)`, `clock.actor`, `observeUnchecked` (event timestamps more than 60 s ahead are ignored).
  * `Transaction`: `readVersion`, `snapshotGet`, `snapshotRange`/`snapshotRangeStored`, `expectKey(path | storedKey, version)`, `addCrdtOps`, `addChunks`, `onCommit`, `onError`.
  * `Tree`: `prepare`/`accept`/`rebase`, `writeIn(tx, ops, chunks)`, `TreeBatch.commitIn(tx)`, `upload` + `writeOp`.
  * Tests: 72 vitest tests (client and fuse).
* **Step 4** was merged with PR #13.
* **Step 5** (`@zen/db` database): planned (see Step 5: sub-steps 5a, 5b and 5c, a PR each).
  * **5a** (foundation): done, in the PR after #13. `packages/db`: `cbor.ts`, `sortkey.ts`, `row.ts`, `keys.ts`, `catalog.ts`, `db.ts` (`Db.open`, `Table`, catalog cache), `txn.ts` (`DbTransaction`, `TableTx`, `changeIndex`), `index/{unique,fast,types}.ts`, `query.ts` (pk, unique, fast, scan), `migrate.ts` (`Migrator`, `migrate`). For the next sub-steps:
    * `changeIndex` (txn.ts) dispatches on `kind`; 5b adds `private` and `sealed` there, to `SUPPORTED` in migrate.ts, and a plan step to `query.ts`. `IndexChange` carries only the CBOR elements: 5b adds the raw values for sort keys.
    * A migration op is paged through `Migrator.run`: progress `{op, key}` in the MigrationRecord; each page re-reads it, so duplicate runners conflict.
    * The catalog cache: a TableRecord is read once per transaction, by its cached version with `expectKey`, and refreshed after a `conflict`. A read-only transaction commits nothing, so `DbTransaction.finish` checks its cached records with one `snapshotGet` and re-runs on a stale one (an extra round trip per read-only transaction; 5c can batch it).
    * Client changes: `Transaction.get/set/delete/range/clearPrefix` take stored keys; new `getAll`, `rangeStored(begin, end, {limit})` (records only the part read), `clearRange`; `transaction()` also re-runs on a retryable `ZenError` thrown inside `fn` (a read's `too_old`, or a check of the caller's).
    * Spec: zendb.md §4.3 clarified (the last part of a padded row is padded to a multiple of 16 KiB; a padded Row that its bucket would push past one value goes to parts).
    * Tests: `packages/db/test/vectors.test.ts` (11; the CBOR duplicate-key refusal can't be expressed in JavaScript and is skipped), `db.test.ts` (22). 109 vitest tests in all. CI typechecks `packages/db/tsconfig.test.json`; it maps `@zen/client` to the client's sources.
  * **5b** (private and sealed indexes): next.

## Facts the work must respect (from the code survey)

**Wasm exposure.** JS can't compute any zendb.md derivation today:
* NK, `kdf`, `prf16` and `H(label, ·)` are not exported. NK is private in `zen-core/src/keys.rs:24`; `kdf` and `prf16` are in `kdf.rs:11,19`.
* `NameChain` is not exported. `kvKey` always starts at the KV root.
* Sealing is per kind; the generic `seal` (`seal.rs:104`) is crate-private.
* There is no CRDT dependency anywhere.

**CBOR.** No JS library handles arbitrary values. The test fixture `testing/cbor.ts` doesn't sort map keys and can't decode. zen-proto uses ciborium, and its determinism for arbitrary values isn't established.

**Client transactions.**
* `Transaction.get` and `range` always record a conflict or expectation. `readVersion` is private.
* `build()` lets `extra` set only `consume`, `chunks` and `crdt_ops`.
* `Tree.send` builds its own commit and owns the HLC tick, accept and rebase logic.

**Clocks.** The event HLC is a per-fs `zw.Clock` (`log.ts:62`), separate from the `TreeClock`.

**Server.**
* `crdt_ops` are validated in `commit.rs::validate` (149–184) and applied through `tree::Engine` (`apply` 670–741, `flush` 744–786) inside `txn_loop!`. The server retries only when there is no `read_version` (`txn.rs:23`).
* `CrdtOp::target()` returns `(fs, tree)`. `CommitResult.dots` comes from the fs write counter.
* `check_clock` (`tree.rs:473`) can be reused.
* The sweeper is `lib.rs:325–356`, then `tree::sweep`, in pages of 1000 with up to 100 rounds.
* `/v1/info` features are hard-coded at `lib.rs:67`. The router is `lib.rs:167–298`.
* **Key prefix clash:** `"cr"` is taken by `keys::chunk_refs` (`keys.rs:396`). zendb.md §19.5's row-register key needs another prefix (`"co"`).

**Tests and CI.**
* `fs.rs` has a xorshift property test against an in-memory reference (353–412). Tests run on both backends with `ZEN_TEST_BACKEND=fdb`.
* Vitest: each test file spawns its own server (`packages/client/test/helpers.ts:20`).
* The CI `client` job is `.github/workflows/ci.yml:89–131`.

## Step 0: persist the plan
* Restart the branch from `main` (above).
* Write `docs/MILESTONE-5.md` (this plan) and link it from DESIGN-3 §6 item 5.
* README status: milestone 5 "in progress".
* Commit and push.

## Step 1: spec fixes found while planning (⚠️ SPEC CHANGES, `spec:` commits)
1. **CRDT rows on the wire:**
   * the key prefixes of zendb.md §19.5 move into `keyspace.md` as §3.8, using `"co"` instead of `"cr"`
   * `api.md` §6 gets the `row`/`lww`/`ctr`/`add`/`rem` CrdtOp variants
   * a new `api.md` §13 holds `/v1/crdt/get` and `/v1/crdt/range` and the `"crdt_rows"` feature
   * `CommitResult` gains `set_dots: [bytes(12)]` for `add` ops. They are numbered among the commit's `add`s, separate from fs `dots`; zendb.md §19.3 is amended.
2. **Deterministic CBOR for zen-db values:** the exact rules (RFC 8949 §4.2.1), float encoding (always 64-bit), and the integer range, in zendb.md §1. The JS and Rust encoders must match the vectors.
3. **`formats.md` §4:** kind 7 is no longer "reserved" once implemented.
4. **Vectors:** `spec/test-vectors/zendb.json`, per zendb.md §17 and §19.9.

## Step 2: zen-core and zen-wasm (Rust)

**zen-core, new module `db`:**
* `DbKeys::new(fs_keys, ns)`, which derives K_db inside Rust, so NK never reaches JS. It provides:
  * `boundary(index_id)` and `node_id(index_id, node_bytes)`
  * `shard(index_id, pk, K)`
  * `crdt(table_id)` → field and element tokens
  * `parts_digest`
* `NameChain` from an arbitrary root, for KV paths under the database. The existing `kv_key` covers `("zen", "db", ns, …)`; check.
* Sort-key encoding (§5.1).
* The prolly canonical chunker: boundary test, levels, Node encoding.
* A deterministic CBOR `Value` encoder and decoder (a small, own implementation, or ciborium plus key sorting).
* `seal_crdt_value` and `open_crdt_value` (kind 7).
* Group id derivation (`zen/v1/broker-group`) on TopicKeys.
* Vectors added to `gen_vectors`.

**zen-wasm:**
* bindings for the above: `FsKeys.db(ns)` → `DbKeys` handle; `TopicKeys.groupId(name)`; `encodeValue`/`decodeValue` (JS value ↔ deterministic CBOR); `sortKey(fields, values, pk)`; `prollyBoundary`/`nodeId`; kind-7 seal and open
* new wire types in `wire.rs`

Every new export goes in a lean module. Re-measure the wasm size and update `docs/STATS.md`.

**As built:** the encodings that need no key (deterministic CBOR, sort keys, rows) are implemented in TypeScript in `@zen/db`, and the Rust ones are their reference: both must reproduce `spec/test-vectors/zendb.json`. Only what needs a key goes through wasm: `FsKeys.db(ns)` → `DbKeys` (`prefix`, `key`, `index` → `IndexKeys` with `isBoundary`, `boundaries`, `shard`, `nodeId`, `build`; `crdt` → `CrdtKeys`), `FsKeys.sealCrdtValue`/`openCrdtValue`, `TopicKeys.groupId`, `partsDigest`. The canonical tree builder is exported for tests of the incremental code. Small spec clarifications came with it: sort keys are capped at 4,096 bytes, the row pad rule at a CBOR head boundary, trailing-zero padding of parts (rows, sealed indexes), and `height = root level + 1`.


## Step 3: server side of CRDT tables (zendb.md §19, TD-CRDT-ROWS-SERVER)
* **zen-proto:**
  * the `CrdtOp` variants `Row`, `Lww`, `Ctr`, `Add`, `Rem`, with `target()` generalized to an enum (tree or object)
  * `CommitResult.set_dots`
  * `CrdtGet`, `CrdtRange` and `ObjState`, with the `ts` derives
* **zen-server:**
  * **`crdt.rs`:** an engine that applies row, lww, ctr, add and rem inside the commit transaction, reusing `check_clock` and `Ts` ordering, with the merge rules of §19.3
  * **`validate`:** permission, `max_value_bytes` and byte estimates per variant
  * **quotas:** quota deltas as KV writes
  * **keyspace:** the `co`/`cw`/`cn`/`cs`/`cv`/`cd` keys
  * **sweeper:** purges dead objects past the horizon, in batches
  * **routes:** `/v1/crdt/get` and `/v1/crdt/range`, with the `fs` read right and paging
  * **`/v1/info`:** advertises `"crdt_rows"`
* **Tests, `tests/crdt.rs`:**
  * the merge rules, skew and horizon, replays (`ctr` seq, idempotent `commit_id`), add-wins, delete vs. update
  * permissions, the sweeper purge
  * **property test:** three devices, random ops, shuffled arrival, compared against an in-memory reference, three seeds (same pattern as `fs.rs`)
  * a cross-node test on FDB
  * every test on both backends

## Step 4: `@zen/client` prerequisites
* **`Transaction`:**
  * `snapshotGet(paths)` and `snapshotRange`: reads at the transaction's read version, with no conflict or expect (for prolly nodes)
  * a public `readVersion`
  * `expectKey(path, version)`, to put cached records into the read set (G9)
* **`Tree`:** split `send` into `prepare(ops)` → `crdt_ops` + chunks, and `accept(result)`, so `tx.fs(tree)` can add ops to a transaction's commit and the rebase runs inside the transaction's retry. Add `Tree.writeIn(tx, …)` for an already-uploaded file.
* **Clocks:** one HLC per session, shared by events, trees and CRDT rows (`TreeClock`).
* `CommitResult.set_dots` passed through.

**Design (from reading `kv.ts`, `tree.ts`, `log.ts` and `commit.rs`):**
1. **`Transaction`** (`packages/client/src/kv.ts`):
   * `readVersion` becomes a public getter, still set by the first read.
   * `snapshotGet(paths)` → `(KvEntry | undefined)[]` and `snapshotRange(prefix | [begin, end), opts)` → an async generator. They read at `readVersion` in short mode (and set it if unset). They record neither a conflict nor an expect, and they overlay the transaction's own writes and clears.
     * To make them share code, `Kv.getEntries` and `rangeStored` also return the response's `read_version`, through an internal variant.
   * `expectKey(path | storedKey, version | undefined)` adds an `expect`. `undefined` means "absent". The server checks `expect` in both modes (`commit.rs:268`), so a cached record joins the read set even in short mode (G9).
   * Hooks for parts that add to the commit:
     * `tx.addCrdtOps(ops)` and `tx.addChunks(chunks)` append to the commit body (today `extra` is overwritten). The existing `extra` stays.
     * `tx.onCommit(fn(result))` runs after a successful commit.
     * `tx.onError(fn(e, attempt) → Promise<boolean>)` can ask for a re-run.
   * `transaction()` re-runs `fn` on a retryable error, or when an `onError` hook returns true. Either way it stays within `attempts`.
2. **`Tree`** (`tree.ts`): the body of `send` splits into three parts, and `send` is rebuilt on them with the same behaviour:
   * `async prepare(ops)` → `Prepared {ops: CrdtOp[], hlcs}`: it syncs the clock once and ticks the `move`/`meta` ops.
   * `accept(p)`: `clock.accept` plus `record` (onOp).
   * `async rebase(p, e, attempt) → boolean`: the existing `stale_op`/`clock_skew` recovery.
   * `async writeIn(tx, ops, chunks?)`:
     * It prepares the ops and adds them (and the chunks) to `tx`.
     * It registers `accept` as an `onCommit` hook and `rebase` as an `onError` hook, so the rebase happens on `transaction`'s re-run, with fresh ticks.
     * `TreeBatch.commitIn(tx)` uses it.
   * `upload(node, data, opts)` → `Upload {ids, manifest, sealedManifest, index, uploaded, commits}`: the chunk half of `writeFile`, with every chunk flushed in its own commits. Unreferenced chunks fall to the existing chunk-grace sweep.
     * `writeOp(node, upload, replaces)` turns an upload into a `write` PendingOp, so an uploaded file goes into a transaction with `writeIn(tx, [op])`.
     * `writeFile` keeps its single-commit fast path. Its last chunks still ride with the `write` op.
3. **One clock per session**: a new `clock.ts` holds `ClockStore`, `memoryClockStore` and `TreeClock` (the name is kept and re-exported, and `SessionClock` is added as an alias).
   * `sessionClock(session)` replaces the `WeakMap` in `tree.ts`. `Session.useClock(clock)`, called before first use, sets a persisted one.
   * `log.ts` drops its per-fs `zw.Clock`: `Topic.seal` ticks the session clock and `open` observes into it. Event HLCs are then ordered with tree ops and CRDT rows.
4. **Counter actor**: `ClockStore` gains optional `loadActor()`/`saveActor(a)`. `TreeClock.actor` (16 bytes) is loaded, or else created randomly once and saved.
   * With the memory store, every process is its own installation, which is correct because its HLC also restarts.
   * Documented: a store must persist the actor together with the HLC, and copying a store to another installation is a bug.
   * (Step 7 can use `clock.tick()` as the `ctr` seq, since it is monotonic per installation.)
5. **`set_dots`**: generated from zen-proto. `tx.result.set_dots` and `send`'s result carry it after `scripts/build-wasm.sh`, and a test checks it.
6. **Docs**: `docs/CLIENT.md` gets snapshot reads, `expectKey`, `writeIn`/`upload`, and the session clock and actor.

**Tests** (`packages/client/test`):
* `kv.test.ts`:
  * a snapshot read followed by a concurrent write commits, where `get` would conflict
  * `readVersion` is exposed
  * a stale `expectKey` conflicts and re-runs; a current one commits
  * an absent key `expectKey(…, undefined)` conflicts once the key is written
  * `addCrdtOps` with a raw `add` op returns `set_dots`
* `tree.test.ts`:
  * `writeIn` together with a KV write commits atomically, and a conflict re-runs both
  * a `stale_op` inside a transaction is rebased (the existing skewed-clock setup)
  * `upload` + `writeOp` + `writeIn`
  * the existing `send` tests unchanged
* `log.test.ts`: an event's HLC lies between two tree ops' HLCs on the same session; the actor persists through a store and is fresh with the memory store.

**Verification:** `scripts/build-wasm.sh`, then `npx biome check`, `npx tsc --noEmit` (client, fuse) and `npx vitest run` (client, fuse).

## Step 5: `@zen/db` part A, the database (zendb.md §1–9, §17)

Three sub-steps, **one PR each**, with the same rhythm as the steps: log, commit, push, PR, then stop for compaction.

**What exists.**
* `packages/db` doesn't exist yet.
* wasm (`crates/zen-wasm/src/db.rs`) gives only what needs a key:
  * `FsKeys.db(ns)` → `DbKeys {prefix, key(elements), index(id), crdt(id)}`
  * `IndexKeys {isBoundary, boundaries(level, keys, fanout), shard, nodeId, build}`
  * `partsDigest`, `TopicKeys.groupId`
* Everything keyless gets written in TS and must match `spec/test-vectors/zendb.json`:
  * deterministic CBOR (`cbor.ok`/`refused_*`)
  * `sort_keys`
  * `rows` (plain, parts, padded, buckets)
  * `prolly`
  * `sealed_index`
  * `database`
* The client `Transaction` (`packages/client/src/kv.ts`) takes stored keys (`Uint8Array`) in `snapshotGet`/`expectKey` but not in `get`/`set`/`delete`/`range`/`clearPrefix`. Its `transaction()` has `short` and `long` but no `auto`, and nothing reports `too_old`→long.

**Common decisions.**
* **Stored keys.** zen-db computes its stored keys with `DbKeys.key([...elements])`. Elements are UTF-8 text, CBOR bytes, 16-byte ids and `u32`/`u64` BE. A small client change widens `Transaction.get`/`set`/`delete`/`clearPrefix`/`range` to `Path | Uint8Array`, the same way `key()` already does (no behaviour change for paths). Sealing stays kind-1, through `fs.sealKeys().sealValue(storedKey, …)`.
* **Errors.** `DbError extends Error {code}`. The codes are `exists`, `not_found`, `unique_violation`, `bad_type`, `schema_newer`, `needs_index`, `too_large`, `corrupt`, `format` and `building` (a duplicate found by a unique backfill). Server errors pass through as `ZenError`.
* **Persistent cache (§9.3, "milestone 5 decides").** Memory only. Recorded in DB.md; the encrypted persistent cache becomes TD-DB-PERSISTENT-CACHE.
* **Oblivious (§5.8).** `kind: "oblivious"` is refused (`format`) at createIndex, per the milestone decision (TD-DB-OBLIVIOUS-INDEX).
* **Change topics (`ChangeDef`).** Stored in the TableRecord now; the appends are emitted by step 6.
* **HLCs.** `created_hlc` and the MigrationRecord `hlc` come from `fs.session.clock.tick()`.
* **Package.** `packages/db`, modelled on `packages/client`'s `package.json`, with a dependency on `@zen/client`, a vitest alias in `vitest.config.ts`, and the TS project wiring the client package uses. Tests go in `packages/db/test`, reusing `packages/client/test/helpers.ts` (`world`, `signInDevice`) through a relative import.

### 5a: foundation, rows, unique and fast indexes, catalog and migrations
**Files** (`packages/db/src/`):
* `cbor.ts`: deterministic encode/decode (§1): shortest heads, integers as numbers in ±2^53 and `bigint` beyond, 64-bit floats, sorted map keys, refusals.
* `sortkey.ts`: §5.1, by declared type, `desc`, escaping, the pk suffix, the 4,096-byte cap.
* `keys.ts`: the `D ‖ …` element builders on `DbKeys`, and their prefix ranges (`prefixEnd`).
* `row.ts`: Row encode/decode (§4.1), parts and digest (§4.2), padding buckets (§4.3), zero-tail checks.
* `catalog.ts`: DbRecord, TableRecord, IndexDef and MigrationRecord codecs (integer-keyed CBOR), plus the in-memory catalog cache with versions.
* `db.ts`: the `Db` class.
  * `zen.db(fs, ns, {schema, migrations})` and `Db.open` (§3.1): unknown format or non-basic integrity → `format`; a newer schema → `schema_newer`; create at 0, then migrate.
  * `db.table<T>(name)` returns a `Table` with `get`/`insert`/`put`/`update`/`delete`.
* `txn.ts`: `DbTransaction`, wrapping a client `Transaction`.
  * `tx.table(t)` CRUD (§4.4), reading the TableRecord into the read set (§7.4) and the old row first.
  * Index maintenance (§5.5) for unique (§5.2: short = conflict read, long = expect-absent) and fast (§5.3).
  * A limits budget (§7.5) checked against `/v1/info` `max_commit_ops`/`max_commit_bytes`/`max_value_bytes` before sending → `too_large`.
  * `db.transaction(fn, {mode: 'short'|'long', attempts})` over client `transaction()`.
* `index/unique.ts`, `index/fast.ts`.
* `query.ts` (first part): plan steps 1–3 and 5 of §6.1 (pk, unique and fast equality, then a scan with a warning and a client-side filter), the other predicates applied client-side, and a cursor for scans (§6.2).
* `migrate.ts` (§8): the runner, with MigrationRecord logging and resume from `progress`.
  * Ops: `createTable`, `dropTable`, `renameTable`, `createIndex`, `dropIndex`, `transform`.
  * Paged backfill with `built_to`, for unique and fast in 5a. The kind-specific "add entries for a page" is a hook that 5b fills in for private and sealed.
  * A unique duplicate → stays `building` with the duplicates reported.
  * Paged drops through `clear_ranges` within `max_range_items`.

**Tests 5a:**
* The TS encoders reproduce the vectors: cbor, sort_keys, rows and database keys.
* CRUD with `exists` and `not_found`; large rows with parts (a lowered `max_value_bytes` in `world({limits})`); padding sizes.
* Unique: a violation; two clients inserting the same value concurrently, where one wins and the other gets `unique_violation` after a retry, in both short and long mode.
* Fast-index equality.
* Long mode.
* Migrations:
  * create, rename and drop
  * `transform`
  * a resume after a simulated kill (throw mid-step, reopen)
  * a unique backfill over existing duplicates
  * a writer during a backfill keeps the index complete
* A schema change concurrent with a write → the write retries.
* `schema_newer`.
* A commit-limit `too_large`.

### 5b: private and sealed indexes, ordered queries
**Files:**
* `index/prolly.ts`:
  * The Node and RootRecord codecs.
  * **Incremental canonical writes (§5.4.4):** re-chunk the touched leaves until a boundary lines up with an old one, level by level, with boundaries batched per level through `IndexKeys.boundaries`. Then write new nodes, delete old ones, and write or delete the root.
  * **Reads (§5.4.3):** the root in the read set, nodes by `snapshotGet` with no conflict, and an immutable per-index node cache by id. A missing node → restart (outside a transaction) or a retry (`conflict`-like re-run via an `onError`/throw inside one).
  * **Shards (§5.4.5):** the shard by `IndexKeys.shard`, and a K-way merge for range reads.
  * **Decoys (§5.4.6):** a random leaf by `count` descent, a fresh salt, the node padding buckets.
  * Changes from one transaction are applied together at commit build (§5.5 last paragraph): writes are collected per index and the tree is rewritten in a pre-commit step of `DbTransaction`.
* `index/sealed.ts` (§5.7): the Blob, parts padded to a power of two, SealedHead with digest and count, a cache validated by the head version, uniqueness checked in the list, `max_bytes` → `too_large`.
* `query.ts`: plan step 4 (a private or sealed range: leading `=` fields plus a range or `orderBy`), `orderBy` on the client otherwise or `needs_index`, `limit`, a sort-key cursor with `after`, `prefix` and `in`, and isolation per §6.3.
* Backfill hooks for private and sealed.

**Tests 5b:**
* TS incremental trees equal the vector tree and `IndexKeys.build` (the Rust reference) after every step.
* **Property:** random insert and delete orders → an identical root and node set.
* Shard selection matches the vectors, and two shards' writers don't conflict.
* Decoys: the node count and sizes stay in buckets, and the tree stays correct.
* A sealed index matches the vectors and its cap.
* **Property:** query results equal a naive in-memory model, over private, sealed and fast; sealed answers like private.
* A missing node under a concurrent writer → a restart.
* Concurrent writers never lose an entry.

### 5c: transaction modes, cache coherence, files, bulk import, tabs
* **`auto` mode (§7.1):** run short; on `too_old`, or after `auto_switch_ms` (default 3,000) via a timer flag checked at the next read or commit, re-run as long. A too-large range in long mode → `too_large`.
* **`db.begin({mode})` (§7.2):** a manual transaction with `commit()`/`abort()` and no retry. `consumes` is added in step 6.
* **Cache coherence (§7.7):** rows and catalog records cached with their version. A transaction using a cached record calls `tx.expectKey` (long) or adds a conflict key (short), so a stale cache retries.
* **Files (§7.6):** `tx.fs(tree)` → `{write(node, upload, opts), ops(…)}` over step 4's `Tree.writeIn`/`upload`/`writeOp`.
* **`importRows(table, rows)`** (§7.5): split by the budget into several commits.
* **`tabs.ts` (§9.2):**
  * The owner is elected with the Web Lock `zen/db/<fs>/<ns>`.
  * Non-owner tabs proxy transactions over a `BroadcastChannel` (serialized function calls are impossible, so proxying covers the table ops and queries, not arbitrary `transaction` closures, which run locally since they are serializable on the server anyway).
  * Without Web Locks, every instance is its own owner.
  * An `owner` event is the hook step 6 uses for consumers, the scheduler and the stream. Node tests use injected fake `locks` and `BroadcastChannel`.
* **Docs:** `docs/DB.md` (the database part).

**Tests 5c:**
* An `auto` switch (a slow function and a forced `too_old`).
* `begin` conflict surfaces.
* A stale cached row → a retry.
* Rows plus a file write in one commit, with a conflict re-running both.
* `importRows` across commits.
* Tab ownership handover with fakes.

**Verification (each sub-step):** `scripts/build-wasm.sh`, then `npx biome check`, `npx tsc --noEmit` (client, fuse, db) and `npx vitest run`. CI's `client` job runs `packages/*/test`, so `@zen/db` is picked up; check that the job's tsc/build step includes the new package.

## Step 6: `@zen/db` part B, the broker (zendb.md §10–13)
* **Base:** `msg.ts` (Msg encoding, BodyRef, causation), `emit`, `on` (plain, `after`, `cursor`), `consume` (group id, the loop table of §11.3, `ack`, `begin({consumes})`), the system tables, ephemeral messages.
* **Patterns:**
  * work queues: spread mode; `retry: "delay"`
  * request/reply: inbox, `serve`, dedup, ephemeral replies, scatter-gather
  * scheduler leader: `$sched`, `gc` jobs, `cancel`
  * sagas: orchestrator, compensations, timeouts
  * `dedup`, `tx.after`, change events
* **Tests:** the guarantees and failures tables of §13, with fault injection:
  * killed handlers mid-transaction, deposed leaders, dropped streams
  * `commit_id` replays, scheduler failover, an owner tab closing (simulated owners)

## Step 7: `@zen/db` part D, CRDT tables (zendb.md §19)
* `crdt.ts`: `patch`, `incr`, `add`, `remove`, `delete`, the merged view through `/v1/crdt/*`
* change-event appends, the `$index` indexer group and `$ixrows`
* the offline queue: memory, or the persisted store of step 8, with rebase on `stale_op`
* `"crdt_rows"` feature detection

**Tests:** offline edits merging, counters across devices, add-wins sets, indexer lag and re-check, an indexer restart.

## Step 8: `@zen/fs`, the local replica (DESIGN-3 §6, TD-FUSE-REPLICA)
* **Model.** The node table and chunk store are kept current through `tree.changes`. Local ops are applied optimistically and queued while offline, then sent (with rebase).
* **POSIX-ish API:** `readFile`, `writeFile` (changed chunks only), `readdir`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `rename`, `unlink`, `rmdir`, `symlink`/`readlink`, xattrs in sealed meta, conflict copies.
* **Stores**, behind an interface:
  * `memory`
  * `node-disk`: a directory of sealed chunk files plus a node-table journal; no native deps
  * `indexeddb`: browser
  
  At rest, everything stays sealed as on the server.
* **`zen-mount`:**
  * moves onto `@zen/fs`
  * offline reads of cached files
  * `--cache-dir` becomes real
  * symlinks and xattrs
  * writes of changed chunks only
  * the existing mount tests stay green, plus offline and symlink tests
* **TDs:** resolve TD-FUSE-REPLICA.

## Step 9: `@zen/loro`, the Loro adapter (DESIGN-3 §0, §1)
* Dependency: `loro-crdt`.
* `zen.loro(db, path)`: a snapshot in a zen-db row, updates as events on a topic keyed by the document.
  * **Load:** snapshot + `read(after snapshot offset)`.
  * **Live:** `on` subscription.
  * **Local edits:** `emit` of Loro updates.
  * **Compaction:** periodic snapshots by a leader (DESIGN-2 §2.7).
* **Tests:** two clients converge; offline edits; a snapshot plus a tail load.

## Step 10: five small web apps (docs/EXAMPLES.md)
* **Layout:** `apps/{kanban,chat,booking,checkout,ledger}`, plain TypeScript and DOM with no framework, bundled with esbuild (a new dev dependency).
* **Serving:** each app is served as static files. In tests, a static server with zen-serve CORS, as in the M4 browser smoke test. They can be deployed into zen-serve's `/unencrypted`.
* **Sign-in:** password or passkey.

| App | Uses |
|---|---|
| Kanban | rows plus attachments in one commit; change events; drag; card text as a Loro doc; offline variant through CRDT fields |
| Chat | `on` with resume; ephemeral typing; presence scatter-gather; photo files; reactions as a CRDT counter |
| Booking | unique slot; waitlist `per_key` worker; reminders through the scheduler |
| Checkout | saga across stock, payment and shipping workers, as Node scripts in `apps/checkout/workers/`, with a mock payment provider that checks idempotency keys |
| Ledger | transfers with invariants; audit outbox; statement projection; paged history |

**Tests:** one Playwright end-to-end test per app, with two browser contexts where the demo needs them, following each app's "Milestone 5 demo" in EXAMPLES.md. The fault parts (killing workers, schedulers, tabs) run as vitest scenarios.

## Step 11: CI, docs, outcome
* **CI:**
  * the `rust` job covers CRDT rows on both backends (the existing fdb job)
  * the `client` job builds and tests `@zen/db`, `@zen/fs` and `@zen/loro`, the apps' bundles, and Playwright for all apps
  * check run time; split jobs if it passes ~15 minutes
* **Docs:**
  * `docs/DB.md`: usage guide of the `Db` class
  * `docs/CLIENT.md`: fs replica, zen-mount, Loro
  * `docs/STATS.md`: wasm size, prolly and sealed costs, broker latencies, CRDT row costs
  * `spec/OPS.md` pitfalls; README
* **TECH_DEBT:**
  * resolve TD-CRDT-ROWS-SERVER and TD-FUSE-REPLICA
  * add TD-DB-OBLIVIOUS-INDEX, plus anything deferred
* **Wrap-up:** the Outcome section, then a PR.

**Parallel agents.** Steps 5–6, 8 and 9 can run as agents on disjoint packages once steps 2–4 have landed. They share one `target/` (OPS.md §4.9) and never push: I verify and push.

## Verification
* **Rust:**
  * `cargo fmt --check`
  * `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, default and `--no-default-features`
  * `cargo test --all`
  * `ZEN_TEST_BACKEND=fdb cargo test -p zen-store -p zen-server --features fdb` on the local cluster
  * the wasm32 checks
  * `gen_vectors` leaves `spec/test-vectors` unchanged
* **JS:** `scripts/build-wasm.sh && npm ci && npx biome check && npx tsc --noEmit` (all packages), `npx vitest run`, `npx playwright test` (the M4 smoke test plus five apps)
* **Manually:** each app's demo script from EXAMPLES.md
* **CI:** green on rust, pure-rust, fdb and client
* **Disk:** `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`; watch disk (8 GB free at the last check).
